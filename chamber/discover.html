            <h3>Demographic Information</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The center of Coyoacán is relatively peaceful during the week, but it becomes crowded and festive on
                weekends and holidays. After the Zocalo, the most-visited place in Mexico City is this historic
                center, especially the twin plazas in its center. According to the borough, the area receives about
                70,000 people each weekend. The area is a stop for both the Turibus and Tranvia Turistico tour bus
                routes, on their routes through San Ángel, Ciudad Universitaria and other locations in the south of
                Mexico City. People come to enjoy the still somewhat rural atmosphere of the area as well as the
                large number of restaurants, cafes, cantinas, museums, bookstores and other cultural attractions. Some
                of these businesses have been around for almost a century.In the two main plazas and even in
                smaller ones such as the one in the neighboring Santa Catarina neighborhood. Mimes, clowns, musicians,
                folk and indigenous dancers, storytellers and other street performers can be found entertaining
                crowds. Vendors sell street food such as ice cream, homemade fruit drinks, esquites (flavored corn
                kernels) and corn-on-the-cob served with mayonnaise, lime, chili pepper and grated cheese, amaranth
                bars, and various candies. In the evening, food vendors tend to sell more hot items such as quesadillas,
                sopes, tortas, tostadas, pozoles and more. One known food vendor, located in the Mercado de Comida
                Coyoacán, goes by the name of Rogelio. He is known for making pancakes (called hotcakes) in the
                shape of animals and humans. These are usually eaten as a snack with jam, cream and other toppings.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>Tourism</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The tourism has been a mixed blessing for the historic center as commercial establishments open, helping
                the economy, but also push residents out. In the historic center, there are over 860 retail businesses,
                mostly restaurants, about 200 of which were established in the last five years. Residents attribute the
                growth to Mexico City's promotion of the area tourism in general as well as the opening of commercial
                centers in the borough. While the growing business helps the economy, resident groups fear that the area
                will lose its current character, as many businesses are opening in formerly residential buildings, with
                questionable legal basis. Currently, most of the borough, especially in historic center, is residential
                with older adults. Property prices are high, leading to sales not to new families but rather to larger
                commercial interests, squeezing out smaller businesses along with residents. Neighborhood groups have
                formed to confront the changes and preserve the historic value of the area. Another serious problem
                for the area is the traffic jams and serious lack of parking in the historic center. The quantity of
                cars and the lack of traffic patrols have meant the proliferation of “franeleros” or people who
                illegally take possession of public areas such as streets to charge for parking.</p>
